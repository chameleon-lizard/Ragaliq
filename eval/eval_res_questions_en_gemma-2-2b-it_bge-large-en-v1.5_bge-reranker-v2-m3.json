Skoltech provides academic mobility opportunities for its best performing students. Academic mobility allows a student\u2019s immersion into a worldwide ecosystem of science, research and innovations and provides a unique opportunity: \n\n- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  \n- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   \n- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   \n- to open new career prospects. *Text Overlay:* \n\n- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  \n- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   \n- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   \n- to open new career prospects. Now, you may ask: who can apply for academic mobility or an academic trip? It could be students who show outstanding academic performance, have a Skoltech research advisor and a preliminarily defined MS thesis project. There are two academic mobility options:   \nFirst \\- Short-term trips to conferences of workshops\n\n*Text Overlay: Short-term trips to conferences of workshops*\n\nThis opportunity usually becomes available when first results of research work emerge, i.e. Term 1 \u2013 3 are completed. An applying student should be active and contributing participant of the event, presenting a paper or a poster. If you learn about an event you want to participate in, discuss it with your advisor or reach out your program coordinator and contactEducation Department to get further instructions and support. Second option \\- Long-term academic mobility\n\n*Text Overlay: Long-term academic mobility*\n\nThese trips are aimed to allow thesis research at highly ranked institutions and recognized research labs around the world. Skoltech competitively selects students\u2019 proposals and provides supporting grants for the approved academic trips. The selection is primarily based on the students\u2019 motivation and justification provided, showing how a trip contributes to the students\u2019 overall educational experience and path. Skoltech also looks at how a proposed mobility opportunity enables students to complete their degree at Skoltech and achieve their post-graduation career goals. The competition process includes primary screening by Education Department and assessment by the Programs. The call for applications is usually announced after Term 3 and the winning applicants schedule their trips to Term 6 \u2013 7\\.
