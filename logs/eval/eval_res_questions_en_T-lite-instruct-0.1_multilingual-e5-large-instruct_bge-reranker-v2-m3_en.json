This is particularly important for those who wish to study abroad or move between institutions within their home country.\n\n3. **Quality Assurance**: The ECTS framework encourages institutions to maintain high standards in course design and delivery, as they are expected to provide clear descriptions of their programs, which are then evaluated by peers and quality assurance bodies.\n\n4. **Flexibility**: Students can plan their studies more freely, as they can choose courses from different universities and combine them into a coherent program. This is especially useful for those who want to tailor their education to their specific needs or interests.\n\n5. **Recognition**: The ECTS system is widely accepted and respected, which means that students",

On top of that, we\u2019ll discuss the Education Process, which covers Academic Structure, the Grading System, and Course Registration. *Text Overlay:* \n\n- *Academic Integrity : Academic Misconduct , Disciplinary Measures*  \n- *Education Process : Academic structure, grading system, course registration* \n\n\nLet\u2019s start with Academic Integrity. It relies on our community\u2019s personal values and policies on ethics, conflict of interest, and others. We expect everyone to: \n\n- Follow professional courtesy  \n- Be committed to honesty without compromising their values  \n- Promote the truth without compromise\n\n*Text Overlay:* \n\n- *Follow professional courtesy*  \n- *Be committed to honesty without compromising their values*  \n- *Promote the truth without compromise*\n\nThis is very important because it leads to the respectful culture that you develop in terms of how you conduct your academic studies, publish in top journals recognized in the most prominent fields, and other achievements. If, at any stage or time, the integrity of your studies is compromised, you will enter the realms of academic misconduct. *Text Overlay: academic misconduct.*\n\nFormal definitions of academic misconduct say that it is the intent of the individual participating in this to cheat the system in some way to gain something in return. \u200b\u200bWhat\u2019s considered academic misconduct? * Deliberate interference with the integrity of others\u2019 work  \n* Fabrication or falsification of data  \n* Unauthorized collaboration  \n* Plagiarism  \n* Cheating\n\n*Text Overlay:* \n\n* *Deliberate interference with the integrity of others\u2019 work*  \n* *Fabrication or falsification of data*  \n* *Unauthorized collaboration*  \n* *Plagiarism*  \n* *Cheating*\n\nResearch Misconduct includes such offenses as:\n\n* Substitution of data  \n* Unrealistic precision of data  \n* Results that contradict known physics\n\n*Text Overlay: Research Misconduct includes such offenses as:*\n\n* *Substitution of data*  \n* *Unrealistic precision of data*  \n* *Results that contradict known physics*\n\nYou can learn more about disciplinary actions by clicking the link below. Discipline is an important part of any academic organization, and in this case Skoltech is no exception. Students who cheat, plagiarize or participate in any other form of academic or research misconduct (including failing classes and violating full time status) are subject to an evaluation by the Skoltech Disciplinary Board (DB). *Text Overlays: Disciplinary Measures at Skoltech*\n\nIf a faculty member witnesses a student\u2019s academic misconduct, the student\u2019s name will be submitted to the Disciplinary Board. Both the student and the witness will be given a chance to explain their positions in writing. Then the Disciplinary Board will make a decision regarding the student\u2019s status at Skoltech. Each case of academic and research misconduct is taken seriously and reviewed on an individual basis. For more information about this, please see the Disciplinary Board Policy via the link below. The DBP Skoltech Disciplinary Board is an internal committee formed in order to address the issues related to student misconduct and the other disputes between students and Skoltech. The Disciplinary Board reviews individual cases related to the following:\n\n- academic misconduct  \n- full-time student status violation  \n- poor academic performance  \n- violation of the attendance regulations  \n- violation (by the students) of other policies  \n- and regulations governing educational  \n- processes  \n- other academic-related issues /conflicts\n\n*Text Overlay:*\n\n- *academic misconduct*  \n- *full-time student status violation*  \n- *poor academic performance*  \n- *violation of the attendance regulations*  \n- *violation (by the students) of other policies*  \n- *and regulations governing educational*\n\nNow this lesson wouldn\u2019t make sense without some actual advice on how to avoid academic and research misconduct. 1.",

First, you need to find a potential research advisor and propose your thesis topic to them by January of your first year. You should then have some development on it done by Terms 3 or 4 of your first year. Then you work on it every term in your second year, with the proposal complete no later than October of your second year.

Skoltech provides academic mobility opportunities for its best performing students. Academic mobility allows a student\u2019s immersion into a worldwide ecosystem of science, research and innovations and provides a unique opportunity: \n\n- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  \n- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   \n- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   \n- to open new career prospects. *Text Overlay:* \n\n- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  \n- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   \n- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   \n- to open new career prospects. Now, you may ask: who can apply for academic mobility or an academic trip? It could be students who show outstanding academic performance, have a Skoltech research advisor and a preliminarily defined MS thesis project. There are two academic mobility options:   \nFirst \\- Short-term trips to conferences of workshops\n\n*Text Overlay: Short-term trips to conferences of workshops*\n\nThis opportunity usually becomes available when first results of research work emerge, i.e. Term 1 \u2013 3 are completed. An applying student should be active and contributing participant of the event, presenting a paper or a poster. If you learn about an event you want to participate in, discuss it with your advisor or reach out your program coordinator and contactEducation Department to get further instructions and support. Second option \\- Long-term academic mobility\n\n*Text Overlay: Long-term academic mobility*\n\nThese trips are aimed to allow thesis research at highly ranked institutions and recognized research labs around the world. Skoltech competitively selects students\u2019 proposals and provides supporting grants for the approved academic trips. The selection is primarily based on the students\u2019 motivation and justification provided, showing how a trip contributes to the students\u2019 overall educational experience and path. Skoltech also looks at how a proposed mobility opportunity enables students to complete their degree at Skoltech and achieve their post-graduation career goals. The competition process includes primary screening by Education Department and assessment by the Programs. The call for applications is usually announced after Term 3 and the winning applicants schedule their trips to Term 6 \u2013 7\\.

This means that students can often continue their studies without having to repeat material they've already mastered.\n\n3. **Recognition of Achievements**: The system helps to ensure that grades and qualifications are understood and respected internationally. It supports the principle of \"learning outcomes\" over \"time spent,\" which is more relevant to the student's actual knowledge and skills.\n\n4. **Mobility Grants and Funding**: Institutions and organizations can use ECTS data to assess the equivalence of study periods, making it easier to apply for scholarships and exchange programs. This simplifies the process of funding international mobility.\n\n5. **Quality Assurance**: The ECTS system encourages universities to maintain high standards, as they must demonstrate that their courses meet certain learning objectives and are comparable to those in other countries.\n\nThese features make it easier for students to pursue their education",

    "feedback": "Feedback:The response correctly identifies some services offered by the Skoltech HelpDesk, aligning with the reference answer's examples of requesting certificates, accessing the gym, and booking a dormitory.  However, the response includes additional services (addressing student-related queries) that are not explicitly mentioned in the reference answer and are too broad to be considered completely accurate within the scope of the question.  While the extra information doesn't make the answer factually incorrect, it deviates from the concise and focused nature of the reference answer.",
