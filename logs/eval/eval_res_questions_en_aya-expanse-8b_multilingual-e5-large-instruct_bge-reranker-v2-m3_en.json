    "source_doc": "\n### Text After Video 3\n\n**Topic 1  \u201c Location & Transportation  \u2014 Premises Location, Public Transport & Carsharing, Personal Cars & Parking\u201d**\n\nBy now you\u2019ve probably heard that our campus and its premises are pretty cool. In fact, you may have visited it during an Open Doors event or perhaps a conference or a summer school. ![][image7]The campus is located within the Skolkovo Innovation Center territory a few minutes away from the center of Moscow. The campus is part of the Skolkovo Innovation Center, which is a closed territory. This means you may need a car pass if you decide to drive here. So, you can reach the campus in multiple ways. **First, you can use public transportation.** \n\nThis is the safest and surest way to reach the campus if you need to be there by a certain time (or just want your arrival time to be predictable). No matter where you are traveling from, you can use Moscow\u2019s MCD-1(Moscow Central Diameter \\#1) metro line to get to the Skolkovo Train station. It\u2019s about a 20 minute ride from the city center. You\u2019ll need to exit the train at the \u201cMCD Skolkovo\u201d (\u0421\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e) station. Once you arrive, take the stairs, escalator or an elevator to the second floor and walk down the looooong hall of the Orbion building. Then, once again, go down to the 1st floor and exit. Once you exit the building, you can take the Sk1 bus shuttle from the nearest bus stop (look to your left). Or, you can take a walk towards the Amaltea business center, walk down the stairs, cross the road and catch any shuttle bus that goes towards Skoltech (the wooden building that looks like a crown, you\u2019ll know it when you see it). This way will take about 10 minutes if you are a fast walker. Remember that the shuttle buses at Skolkovo have paid fares (same as within the Moscow public transportation system, we\u2019ll talk about that in the next modules) and can be tracked via [Yandex maps](https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/?ll=37.622504%2C55.753215\\&z=10) \n\n[(links to an external site)](https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/?ll=37.622504%2C55.753215\\&z=10)\n\nBy the way, the Skolkovo Innovation Center website also has some tips on how to reach other buildings on the territory. Visit [https://sk.ru/transport/](https://sk.ru/transport/) \n\n[(links to an external site)](https://sk.ru/transport/)\n\nfor more information. ![][image8]\n\n \n\nThe next best thing is to take a taxi\n\nCurrently, only taxi services [Yandex (links to an external site)](https://taxi.yandex.ru/ru\\_ru/) , [Citi Mobil](https://city-mobil.ru/) \n\n[(links to an external site)](https://city-mobil.ru/) , and [Uber  (links to an external site)](https://support-uber.com/) have automatic access to the Skolkovo Innovation Center. All you need to do is download a relevant app to your smartphone, order a taxi to Skoltech (just type \u201c\u0421\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0435\u0445\u201d in the destination, it will be there) and relax. Don\u2019t forget to buckle up\\! If you take a different taxi service, you\u2019ll need to order a territory pass ahead of time. To order a pass for your taxi, email security.campus@skoltech.ru from your Skoltech email address with your taxi\u2019s model and license number (i.e. Toyota, \u0425111\u0421\u041a197).",

You can buy yourself single- or double-ride tickets or get a permanent Troika card and top off its balance every once in a while. If you\u2019re planning to explore the city center, we recommend using the underground metro. Yandex Metro app (links to an external site)has the current map and allows you to plan your route to point A to point B. The metro is designed in a sun-like way, with multi-colored lines stemming away from the center outwards. There are also several circle lines which connect them. You will notice on the map (and have already seen it mentioned in this course) the MCD lines. These are newer extensions of the metro line that take you a little bit outside of the city for a few extra rubles. One of these lines, MCD 1, takes you almost directly to Skoltech and is the best way to get to campus from the city center. If you use the metro app to plan your route, select the stop called \u201cSkolkovo\u201d and it will calculate your route for you. Easy, huh\\! If you live or end up far away from a metro station, you can take the bus, a tramway or a small overground shuttle (aka marshrutka). The Yandex Transport app shows you the nearest stops, when the next bus, tram or shuttle will arrive there and where it can take you. You can also plan your route there.\nSim: 1.28 - \u2192 From there, take an SK1 shuttle and exit at the Technopark stop. The Skoltech dorms will be on your right\\!

First, you need to find a potential research advisor and propose your thesis topic to them by January of your first year. You should then have some development on it done by Terms 3 or 4 of your first year. Then you work on it every term in your second year, with the proposal complete no later than October of your second year. Your status review presentations should be done in the Winter Term of your second year. Then it\u2019s onto the thesis draft and pre-defenses by May of your second year, and a final defense in June of your second year. Right now, you don\u2019t need to worry about securing your research topic or anything like that. However, we know from experience that one of the keys to success in your MSc Thesis Project is selecting the right advisor. So, here are a few tips:\n\n- Take classes from different instructors and spend time getting to know them  \n- Gather feedback from older MSc and PhD students about their experience  \n- Try to participate in the lab work of several different labs  \n- Keep an open mind, even if you\u2019ve already decided who who want to work with  \n- Pay attention to how you work together, not just chat after class.

Skoltech provides academic mobility opportunities for its best performing students. Academic mobility allows a student\u2019s immersion into a worldwide ecosystem of science, research and innovations and provides a unique opportunity: \n\n- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  \n- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   \n- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   \n- to open new career prospects. *Text Overlay:* \n\n- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  \n- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   \n- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   \n- to open new career prospects. Now, you may ask: who can apply for academic mobility or an academic trip? It could be students who show outstanding academic performance, have a Skoltech research advisor and a preliminarily defined MS thesis project. There are two academic mobility options:   \nFirst \\- Short-term trips to conferences of workshops\n\n*Text Overlay: Short-term trips to conferences of workshops*\n\nThis opportunity usually becomes available when first results of research work emerge, i.e. Term 1 \u2013 3 are completed. An applying student should be active and contributing participant of the event, presenting a paper or a poster. If you learn about an event you want to participate in, discuss it with your advisor or reach out your program coordinator and contactEducation Department to get further instructions and support. Second option \\- Long-term academic mobility\n\n*Text Overlay: Long-term academic mobility*\n\nThese trips are aimed to allow thesis research at highly ranked institutions and recognized research labs around the world. Skoltech competitively selects students\u2019 proposals and provides supporting grants for the approved academic trips. The selection is primarily based on the students\u2019 motivation and justification provided, showing how a trip contributes to the students\u2019 overall educational experience and path. Skoltech also looks at how a proposed mobility opportunity enables students to complete their degree at Skoltech and achieve their post-graduation career goals. The competition process includes primary screening by Education Department and assessment by the Programs. The call for applications is usually announced after Term 3 and the winning applicants schedule their trips to Term 6 \u2013 7\\. Moving on to Funding. *Text Overlay: Funding*\n\nCan be provided from a research advisor\u2019s funds or a CREI budget. Long-Term trips are supported by Education Department. We have prepared information on how to apply for you, along with guidelines for reporting after the academic trip, which you can find in the description below.

A current list of all Skolkovo parking lots is published on [sta-parking.ru (links to an external site).](https://www.sta-parking.ru/) (RUS). ![][image9]\n\n \n\nIn terms of parking prices, parking is free for 2 hours and then 50 RUB per hour. Spaces are pretty limited, though. To secure a spot and entry in the long-term, you can email Clients@sta-parking.ru. Monthly parking plans start at 5000 RUB/month. Finally, you can also park outside of the Skolkovo territory. You can try the [Tri Kita Mall parking lot (links to an external site)](https://yandex.ru/maps/org/tri\\_kita/1112120378/?indoorLevel=1\\&ll=37.355723%2C55.702835\\&z=17.03) or near the [\u201cInnovatsya\u201d apartments (links to an external site)](https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/?indoorLevel=1\\&ll=37.355723%2C55.702835\\&mode=poi\\&poi%5Bpoint%5D=37.357476%2C55.700718\\&poi%5Buri%5D=ymapsbm1%3A%2F%2Forg%3Foid%3D191529528774\\&z=17.03), but spaces there are not guaranteed. **Carsharing is another option.** \n\nA great option for transportation without the upkeep fees, are we right?

If you choose to use a different car sharing service, you may need to search for a different parking option outside of the Skolkovo Innovation Center Territory (for example, there is an \u201cexternal\u201d parking lot just behind the Skoltech campus that\u2019s not part of the Skolkovo infrastructure). In that case, we suggest looking for an \u201cend destination\u201d spot ahead of time. *Phew, we\u2019re almost there:)*\n\nAre you up for a scooter or a bike ride? The Skolkovo territory has lots of electric scooter and bike stations where you can rent one from March to November (watch out for puddles\\!). For instance, there is a bike/scooter stop right outside of the MCD Skolkovo station so you can start your day with a breeze. To rent one of these sweet rides, scan a QR code on the vehicle and follow the instructions.

One of such programs is Industrial Immersion. What is industrial immersion? Industrial immersion is a compulsory educational element aimed at getting a real hands-on work experience in the industrial sector. Basically, this is your mandatory summer internship which grants you 12 credits upon successful completion. *Text Overlay:  12 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432*\n\nSo, for 8 weeks in the summer, you will do a short term task of operational research and manufacturing problems provided by the host company. Industrial immersion is a full time, in-person gig that happens at the host company\u2019s office with your total commitment. The enrollment process status begins in Term 3\\. You can find more detailed information about Industrial Immersion via the links in the description. Also, we must stress the importance of having a good CV. You\u2019ve submitted one for admission to Skoltech, remember? Now, the companies will select students for projects solely based on their CV and self-representation, so it\u2019s important to fine-tune it as best you can. *Text Overlay:* \n\n- *resume*  \n- *self-representation* \n\nIn your CV, you must show relevant experience, highlight projects you will have worked on by the time of application and make sure your writing is top-notch. So we strongly recommend that you visit the Career Center and take a resume writing course in January to get the most out of your experience. *Text Overlay: Career Center*\n\nSpeaking of experience, Industrial Immersion itself will totally count as work experience for your future career and resume. In fact, many Skoltech students receive job offers and valuable connections for future jobs at Industrial Immersion. So, a pretty cool opportunity, huh? Now let\u2019s talk about Industrial Immersion\u2019s milestones and overall timeline. *Text Overlay: Milestones and Timeline*  \n*Use the following graph:*  \n![][image14]  \n*Your major milestones can be broken up into two-month long periods. First, in January and February, you submit your CV. Make sure to spend some time preparing it in advance: visit the Career Center and take an ISP course to help you write a top-notch resume.*  \n*Next, in February and March, you need to submit your self-initiated project for approval, if you\u2019re planning on doing one. This is also when companies work with us to propose their own projects and select students based on their CV.*  \n*In April and May, you will be assigned to projects in companies, and go through mandatory interviews as a part of this process.*  \n*In June and July, you complete your industrial immersion project. You have eight weeks to do so.*  \n*You will spend your July and August preparing your project reports, and submit a poster with your results for assessment by the end.*  \n*And finally, in the fall, you will present your poster at our Industry Day and receive academic credit towards your degree.*\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of steps to follow, right? Something we should stress here is even though you will be notified at the start of each stage, the responsibility for completing the industrial immersion component for your degree is *fully your responsibility*. You are responsible adults, after all. So, don\u2019t view Industrial Immersion as some basic 12 credits towards your degree.

Academic mobility allows a student\u2019s immersion into a worldwide ecosystem of science, research and innovations and provides a unique opportunity: \n\n- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  \n- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   \n- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   \n- to open new career prospects. *Text Overlay:* \n\n- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  \n- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   \n- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   \n- to open new career prospects. Now, you may ask: who can apply for academic mobility or an academic trip? It could be students who show outstanding academic performance, have a Skoltech research advisor and a preliminarily defined MS thesis project. There are two academic mobility options:   \nFirst \\- Short-term trips to conferences of workshops\n\n*Text Overlay: Short-term trips to conferences of workshops*\n\nThis opportunity usually becomes available when first results of research work emerge, i.e. Term 1 \u2013 3 are completed. An applying student should be active and contributing participant of the event, presenting a paper or a poster. If you learn about an event you want to participate in, discuss it with your advisor or reach out your program coordinator and contactEducation Department to get further instructions and support. Second option \\- Long-term academic mobility\n\n*Text Overlay: Long-term academic mobility*\n\nThese trips are aimed to allow thesis research at highly ranked institutions and recognized research labs around the world. Skoltech competitively selects students\u2019 proposals and provides supporting grants for the approved academic trips. The selection is primarily based on the students\u2019 motivation and justification provided, showing how a trip contributes to the students\u2019 overall educational experience and path. Skoltech also looks at how a proposed mobility opportunity enables students to complete their degree at Skoltech and achieve their post-graduation career goals. The competition process includes primary screening by Education Department and assessment by the Programs. The call for applications is usually announced after Term 3 and the winning applicants schedule their trips to Term 6 \u2013 7\\. Moving on to Funding. *Text Overlay: Funding*\n\nCan be provided from a research advisor\u2019s funds or a CREI budget. Long-Term trips are supported by Education Department. We have prepared information on how to apply for you, along with guidelines for reporting after the academic trip, which you can find in the description below. You can also find out more about your Student Status \u2014 Active Status Requirements, Academic Leave, Withdrawal & Reinstatement. Please take the time to study this in detail. *Text Overlay : Student Status \u2014 Active Status Requirements, Academic Leave, Withdrawal & Reinstatement.* \n",

It relies on our community\u2019s personal values and policies on ethics, conflict of interest, and others. We expect everyone to: \n\n- Follow professional courtesy  \n- Be committed to honesty without compromising their values  \n- Promote the truth without compromise\n\n*Text Overlay:* \n\n- *Follow professional courtesy*  \n- *Be committed to honesty without compromising their values*  \n- *Promote the truth without compromise*\n\nThis is very important because it leads to the respectful culture that you develop in terms of how you conduct your academic studies, publish in top journals recognized in the most prominent fields, and other achievements. If, at any stage or time, the integrity of your studies is compromised, you will enter the realms of academic misconduct. *Text Overlay: academic misconduct.*\n\nFormal definitions of academic misconduct say that it is the intent of the individual participating in this to cheat the system in some way to gain something in return. \u200b\u200bWhat\u2019s considered academic misconduct? * Deliberate interference with the integrity of others\u2019 work  \n* Fabrication or falsification of data  \n* Unauthorized collaboration  \n* Plagiarism  \n* Cheating\n\n*Text Overlay:* \n\n* *Deliberate interference with the integrity of others\u2019 work*  \n* *Fabrication or falsification of data*  \n* *Unauthorized collaboration*  \n* *Plagiarism*  \n* *Cheating*\n\nResearch Misconduct includes such offenses as:\n\n* Substitution of data  \n* Unrealistic precision of data  \n* Results that contradict known physics\n\n*Text Overlay: Research Misconduct includes such offenses as:*\n\n* *Substitution of data*  \n* *Unrealistic precision of data*  \n* *Results that contradict known physics*\n\nYou can learn more about disciplinary actions by clicking the link below.

Both the student and the witness will be given a chance to explain their positions in writing. Then the Disciplinary Board will make a decision regarding the student\u2019s status at Skoltech. Each case of academic and research misconduct is taken seriously and reviewed on an individual basis. For more information about this, please see the Disciplinary Board Policy via the link below. The DBP Skoltech Disciplinary Board is an internal committee formed in order to address the issues related to student misconduct and the other disputes between students and Skoltech.

First, you need to find a potential research advisor and propose your thesis topic to them by January of your first year. You should then have some development on it done by Terms 3 or 4 of your first year. Then you work on it every term in your second year, with the proposal complete no later than October of your second year. Your status review presentations should be done in the Winter Term of your second year. Then it\u2019s onto the thesis draft and pre-defenses by May of your second year, and a final defense in June of your second year. Right now, you don\u2019t need to worry about securing your research topic or anything like that. However, we know from experience that one of the keys to success in your MSc Thesis Project is selecting the right advisor. So, here are a few tips:\n\n- Take classes from different instructors and spend time getting to know them  \n- Gather feedback from older MSc and PhD students about their experience  \n- Try to participate in the lab work of several different labs  \n- Keep an open mind, even if you\u2019ve already decided who who want to work with  \n- Pay attention to how you work together, not just chat after class.

Academic mobility allows a student\u2019s immersion into a worldwide ecosystem of science, research and innovations and provides a unique opportunity: \n\n- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  \n- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   \n- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   \n- to open new career prospects. *Text Overlay:* \n\n- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  \n- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   \n- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   \n- to open new career prospects. Now, you may ask: who can apply for academic mobility or an academic trip? It could be students who show outstanding academic performance, have a Skoltech research advisor and a preliminarily defined MS thesis project. There are two academic mobility options:   \nFirst \\- Short-term trips to conferences of workshops\n\n*Text Overlay: Short-term trips to conferences of workshops*\n\nThis opportunity usually becomes available when first results of research work emerge, i.e. Term 1 \u2013 3 are completed. An applying student should be active and contributing participant of the event, presenting a paper or a poster. If you learn about an event you want to participate in, discuss it with your advisor or reach out your program coordinator and contactEducation Department to get further instructions and support. Second option \\- Long-term academic mobility\n\n*Text Overlay: Long-term academic mobility*\n\nThese trips are aimed to allow thesis research at highly ranked institutions and recognized research labs around the world. Skoltech competitively selects students\u2019 proposals and provides supporting grants for the approved academic trips. The selection is primarily based on the students\u2019 motivation and justification provided, showing how a trip contributes to the students\u2019 overall educational experience and path. Skoltech also looks at how a proposed mobility opportunity enables students to complete their degree at Skoltech and achieve their post-graduation career goals. The competition process includes primary screening by Education Department and assessment by the Programs.

Discipline is an important part of any academic organization, and in this case Skoltech is no exception. Students who cheat, plagiarize or participate in any other form of academic or research misconduct (including failing classes and violating full time status) are subject to an evaluation by the Skoltech Disciplinary Board (DB). *Text Overlays: Disciplinary Measures at Skoltech*\n\nIf a faculty member witnesses a student\u2019s academic misconduct, the student\u2019s name will be submitted to the Disciplinary Board. Both the student and the witness will be given a chance to explain their positions in writing. Then the Disciplinary Board will make a decision regarding the student\u2019s status at Skoltech. Each case of academic and research misconduct is taken seriously and reviewed on an individual basis. For more information about this, please see the Disciplinary Board Policy via the link below. The DBP Skoltech Disciplinary Board is an internal committee formed in order to address the issues related to student misconduct and the other disputes between students and Skoltech. The Disciplinary Board reviews individual cases related to the following:\n\n- academic misconduct  \n- full-time student status violation  \n- poor academic performance  \n- violation of the attendance regulations  \n- violation (by the students) of other policies  \n- and regulations governing educational  \n- processes  \n- other academic-related issues /conflicts\n\n*Text Overlay:*\n\n- *academic misconduct*  \n- *full-time student status violation*  \n- *poor academic performance*  \n- *violation of the attendance regulations*  \n- *violation (by the students) of other policies*  \n- *and regulations governing educational*\n\nNow this lesson wouldn\u2019t make sense without some actual advice on how to avoid academic and research misconduct. 1.",
