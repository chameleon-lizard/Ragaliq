In fact, you may have visited it during an Open Doors event or perhaps a conference or a summer school. ![][image7]The campus is located within the Skolkovo Innovation Center territory a few minutes away from the center of Moscow. The campus is part of the Skolkovo Innovation Center, which is a closed territory. This means you may need a car pass if you decide to drive here. So, you can reach the campus in multiple ways. **First, you can use public transportation.** \n\nThis is the safest and surest way to reach the campus if you need to be there by a certain time (or just want your arrival time to be predictable). No matter where you are traveling from, you can use Moscow\u2019s MCD-1(Moscow Central Diameter \\#1) metro line to get to the Skolkovo Train station. It\u2019s about a 20 minute ride from the city center. You\u2019ll need to exit the train at the \u201cMCD Skolkovo\u201d (\u0421\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e) station. Once you arrive, take the stairs, escalator or an elevator to the second floor and walk down the looooong hall of the Orbion building. Then, once again, go down to the 1st floor and exit. Once you exit the building, you can take the Sk1 bus shuttle from the nearest bus stop (look to your left). Or, you can take a walk towards the Amaltea business center, walk down the stairs, cross the road and catch any shuttle bus that goes towards Skoltech (the wooden building that looks like a crown, you\u2019ll know it when you see it). This way will take about 10 minutes if you are a fast walker. Remember that the shuttle buses at Skolkovo have paid fares (same as within the Moscow public transportation system, we\u2019ll talk about that in the next modules) and can be tracked via [Yandex maps](https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/?ll=37.622504%2C55.753215\\&z=10) \n\n[(links to an external site)](https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/?ll=37.622504%2C55.753215\\&z=10)\n\nBy the way, the Skolkovo Innovation Center website also has some tips on how to reach other buildings on the territory. Visit [https://sk.ru/transport/](https://sk.ru/transport/) \n\n[(links to an external site)](https://sk.ru/transport/)\n\nfor more information. ![][image8]\n\n \n\nThe next best thing is to take a taxi\n\nCurrently, only taxi services [Yandex (links to an external site)](https://taxi.yandex.ru/ru\\_ru/) , [Citi Mobil](https://city-mobil.ru/) \n\n[(links to an external site)](https://city-mobil.ru/) , and [Uber  (links to an external site)](https://support-uber.com/) have automatic access to the Skolkovo Innovation Center. All you need to do is download a relevant app to your smartphone, order a taxi to Skoltech (just type \u201c\u0421\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0435\u0445\u201d in the destination, it will be there) and relax. Don\u2019t forget to buckle up\\! If you take a different taxi service, you\u2019ll need to order a territory pass ahead of time. To order a pass for your taxi, email security.campus@skoltech.ru from your Skoltech email address with your taxi\u2019s model and license number (i.e. Toyota, \u0425111\u0421\u041a197).",

You can buy yourself single- or double-ride tickets or get a permanent Troika card and top off its balance every once in a while. If you\u2019re planning to explore the city center, we recommend using the underground metro. Yandex Metro app (links to an external site)has the current map and allows you to plan your route to point A to point B. The metro is designed in a sun-like way, with multi-colored lines stemming away from the center outwards. There are also several circle lines which connect them. You will notice on the map (and have already seen it mentioned in this course) the MCD lines. These are newer extensions of the metro line that take you a little bit outside of the city for a few extra rubles. One of these lines, MCD 1, takes you almost directly to Skoltech and is the best way to get to campus from the city center. If you use the metro app to plan your route, select the stop called \u201cSkolkovo\u201d and it will calculate your route for you. Easy, huh\\! If you live or end up far away from a metro station, you can take the bus, a tramway or a small overground shuttle (aka marshrutka).

The exact method of calculation depends on the algorithm used, but it often involves comparing the texts on various levels, such as word frequency, semantic meaning, or even the structure of sentences.\n\nHere are some common methods:\n\n1. **Cosine Similarity**: This is a popular choice for text analysis. It measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a high-dimensional space, where each vector represents a document. The closer to 1, the more similar the documents are.\n\n2. **Jaccard Similarity**: This is a metric for set similarity, which can be applied to word sets. It calculates the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sets.\n\n3. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: This is a statistical measure that evaluates how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It can be used to compare documents by creating a vector space model.\n\n4. **Word Embedding Techniques**: These methods, like Word2Vec or GloVe, create dense vectors for words, allowing for a more nuanced comparison based on semantic relationships.\n\nIn your case, the score of 2.85 could be a result of a specific algorithm's output, but without knowing the exact method, it's hard to say what this number specifically means. It might be a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates no similarity and 1 indicates identical content.

A Policy is an official document passed by Skoltech\u2019s leadership team to optimize the university\u2019s functions and/or activities. For instance, you can hear something like \u201cSkoltech Policy on Student Scholarships and Other Benefits\u201d or \u201cSkoltech\u2019s IP policy\u201d, which, btw, you will learn about in the next modules.

As a student, you have incredible freedom to explore your passions, try your hand in different subject areas and even work-related activities.

The Student Council represents the interests of all students through the following activities:\nSim: 3.04 - The policies don\u2019t just appear out of thin air: their formation is a long process that involves all the leadership and representative parties of Skoltech you\u2019ve read about already. That includes the students, too. In fact, before a policy is drafted, **Skoltech makes sure to give the students the opportunity to voice their concerns or opinions** on the issue in question through the Student Council. You can also participate in working groups and contribute your feedback any time. So this way, you the students are quite literally the policy makers of the institute\\!\nSim: 2.41 - 4\\. To organize student activities: the Student Council organizes events for the Skoltech student community and coordinates activities of student clubs. \nSim: 2.08 - Here\u2019s something you probably understood from previous modules is that student voices are heard and listened to at Skoltech. In fact, the university encourages students to voice their opinions on any issues and play an active role in the development of our university. After all, you are the ones studying here, not the president, the faculty, or the administrators :) To help you voice your position and launch initiatives there is a student-run organization called the Student Council.\nSim: 1.93 - The best thing about the Student Council is you can join it, too.

The elections of the Board take place at the end of each academic year and the elections for the SC Body and the Active Team occur in the beginning of the academic year, so any new student can join the SC Body or the Active Team. As a member of the Student Council you can influence the decisions made at Skoltech, shape your own and your fellow students\u2019 experience and play a key role in drawing new policies at the university. \nSim: 1.86 - So, who is behind Skoltech? You will obviously get to know your professors and fellow students in the next few weeks, but you should also probably know who runs the university on the administrative side. You know, just to have an idea. Skoltech was founded by the top Russian companies and leading institutes. Among them are VEB.RF, Sber, MIPT, New Economic School, Moscow School of Management.The Founders are entitled to approve the Charter, establish the Institute's governance bodies, and appoint the Board of Trustees. You can read more about the Founders below. Honored academics, statesmen and businessmen make up the Board of Trustees. Members of the Board set and hold Skoltech accountable for following its strategies, as well as oversee the development of the university. The final key player of the Skoltech government bodies is the Student Council, whose role is to voice student needs to the university administration. Each year, students elect the Council and its President, Vice President and Coordinator to represent you over the course of the next academic year. You will learn more about the Student Council\u2019s role and activities in the next module.Meanwhile, let\u2019s see what happens behind the scenes of the day-to-day management\\! Below you will see Skoltech\u2019s current leadership team . It consists of the University President and Provost, as well as several Vice Presidents and Deans responsible for different areas of the university\u2019s management.
