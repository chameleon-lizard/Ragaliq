The higher the cosine similarity, the more similar the documents.\n\n2. **Jaccard Similarity**: This is a measure of the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of two sets (in this case, sets of words). It's useful when you want to compare the presence of specific terms.\n\n3. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: This is a way to weigh the importance of a word in a document. It combines the frequency of a word in a document with the rarity of the word across all documents. The similarity can be calculated by comparing TF-IDF vectors.\n\nIn your case, the score of 2.92 might be a result of a specific algorithm or tool used to analyze the documents.

Aim to get as close to an A as possible, as it comes with many obvious and not-so-obvious benefits like scholarships :)   \n* F is a failing grade, which means you will not have passed the course if you get it. If you ever feel you are having trouble with a course and are likely to receive a poor grade, talk to your instructor as soon as possible. * Some projects have a Pass/Fail grading scale, and you will be notified in advance if that applies to your course. * The course instructor sets the grading scheme for each class, which is explained in the Course Syllabus.

We expect everyone to: \n\n- Follow professional courtesy  \n- Be committed to honesty without compromising their values  \n- Promote the truth without compromise\n\n*Text Overlay:* \n\n- *Follow professional courtesy*  \n- *Be committed to honesty without compromising their values*  \n- *Promote the truth without compromise*\n\nThis is very important because it leads to the respectful culture that you develop in terms of how you conduct your academic studies, publish in top journals recognized in the most prominent fields, and other achievements. If, at any stage or time, the integrity of your studies is compromised, you will enter the realms of academic misconduct. *Text Overlay: academic misconduct.*\n\nFormal definitions of academic misconduct say that it is the intent of the individual participating in this to cheat the system in some way to gain something in return. \u200b\u200bWhat\u2019s considered academic misconduct? * Deliberate interference with the integrity of others\u2019 work  \n* Fabrication or falsification of data  \n* Unauthorized collaboration  \n* Plagiarism  \n* Cheating\n\n*Text Overlay:* \n\n* *Deliberate interference with the integrity of others\u2019 work*  \n* *Fabrication or falsification of data*  \n* *Unauthorized collaboration*  \n* *Plagiarism*  \n* *Cheating*\n\nResearch Misconduct includes such offenses as:\n\n* Substitution of data  \n* Unrealistic precision of data  \n* Results that contradict known physics\n\n*Text Overlay: Research Misconduct includes such offenses as:*\n\n* *Substitution of data*  \n* *Unrealistic precision of data*  \n* *Results that contradict known physics*\n\nYou can learn more about disciplinary actions by clicking the link below.

How is it calculated?<|eot_id|><|eot_id|>assistant\n\nThe similarity score in this context is a measure of how closely the two documents resemble each other in terms of their content. It is calculated using a technique called cosine similarity, which is a common method for comparing the similarity of textual data.\n\n### How Cosine Similarity Works:\n\n1. **Vector Representation**: Each document is represented as a vector in a high-dimensional space. The dimensionality is determined by the number of unique words in the corpus (all documents considered together). Each word is a dimension, and the value of that dimension is the frequency of the word in the document.\n\n2. **Dot Product**: The cosine similarity is calculated as the dot product of the two vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes (lengths). The dot product is the sum of the products of corresponding elements in the vectors, and the magnitude is the square root of the sum of the squares of the vector elements.\n\n3. **Cosine of the Angle**: The result of the dot product divided by the product of the magnitudes is the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. This angle represents the similarity between the documents. The closer the cosine value is to 1, the more similar the documents are; 0 indicates no similarity, and -1 indicates opposite directions (i.e., completely dissimilar).\n\n### Interpretation of the Score:\n\n- **0.0 to 1."

You\u2019ll see the price in advance, would be able to choose the type of the vehicle (considering your bags) and can pay by credit card if you don't have cash on you yet.\nSim: 2.73 - The closest metro stations like Yugo-Zapadnaya, Park Pobedy & Slavyansky Boulevard have bus stops with direct routes to Skolkovo and should get you to the campus within 45 minutes.\nSim: 2.54 - Finally, if you are in a huge rush, feel free to catch a taxi.

In fact, you may have visited it during an Open Doors event or perhaps a conference or a summer school. ![][image7]The campus is located within the Skolkovo Innovation Center territory a few minutes away from the center of Moscow. The campus is part of the Skolkovo Innovation Center, which is a closed territory. This means you may need a car pass if you decide to drive here. So, you can reach the campus in multiple ways. **First, you can use public transportation.** \n\nThis is the safest and surest way to reach the campus if you need to be there by a certain time (or just want your arrival time to be predictable). No matter where you are traveling from, you can use Moscow\u2019s MCD-1(Moscow Central Diameter \\#1) metro line to get to the Skolkovo Train station. It\u2019s about a 20 minute ride from the city center. You\u2019ll need to exit the train at the \u201cMCD Skolkovo\u201d (\u0421\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u043e) station. Once you arrive, take the stairs, escalator or an elevator to the second floor and walk down the looooong hall of the Orbion building. Then, once again, go down to the 1st floor and exit. Once you exit the building, you can take the Sk1 bus shuttle from the nearest bus stop (look to your left). Or, you can take a walk towards the Amaltea business center, walk down the stairs, cross the road and catch any shuttle bus that goes towards Skoltech (the wooden building that looks like a crown, you\u2019ll know it when you see it). This way will take about 10 minutes if you are a fast walker. Remember that the shuttle buses at Skolkovo have paid fares (same as within the Moscow public transportation system, we\u2019ll talk about that in the next modules) and can be tracked via [Yandex maps](https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/?ll=37.622504%2C55.753215\\&z=10) \n\n[(links to an external site)](https://yandex.ru/maps/213/moscow/?ll=37.622504%2C55.753215\\&z=10)\n\nBy the way, the Skolkovo Innovation Center website also has some tips on how to reach other buildings on the territory.

All you need to do is download a relevant app to your smartphone, order a taxi to Skoltech (just type \u201c\u0421\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0435\u0445\u201d in the destination, it will be there) and relax. Don\u2019t forget to buckle up\\! If you take a different taxi service, you\u2019ll need to order a territory pass ahead of time.

The metro is designed in a sun-like way, with multi-colored lines stemming away from the center outwards. There are also several circle lines which connect them. You will notice on the map (and have already seen it mentioned in this course) the MCD lines. These are newer extensions of the metro line that take you a little bit outside of the city for a few extra rubles. One of these lines, MCD 1, takes you almost directly to Skoltech and is the best way to get to campus from the city center.

Academic hours, on the other hand, are a more specific measure of the time spent in a classroom or on direct instruction, typically 1.5 times the number of astronomical hours.

This helps to avoid subjective grading and promotes fairness.\n\n3. **Credit Allocation**: The ECTS credit system is based on a standardized workload, which means that the amount of time and effort required to complete a course is comparable across institutions. This helps to create a common denominator for the value of a course.\n\n4. **Transfer and Accumulation**: Students can transfer credits from one institution to another, as the ECTS system allows for easy recognition of completed work.

This could be beneficial if you're planning to specialize in entrepreneurship or if you want to quickly gain a solid foundation.\n\n2. **Customization and Variety**: The 24-credit track, with its electives and project-based elements, allows for a more personalized learning journey. This might be appealing to students who wish to explore different aspects of the field, gain practical experience, or tailor their education to their specific career goals.

The MSc Thesis Project is the essence of your time at Skoltech. *Text Overlay: MSc Thesis Project*\n\nThis is where you will spend the majority of your \u201cextra\u201d time outside of your formal curriculum. ![][image15]  \nThe milestones for your MSc Thesis Project are pretty straightforward. First, you need to find a potential research advisor and propose your thesis topic to them by January of your first year. You should then have some development on it done by Terms 3 or 4 of your first year. Then you work on it every term in your second year, with the proposal complete no later than October of your second year. Your status review presentations should be done in the Winter Term of your second year. Then it\u2019s onto the thesis draft and pre-defenses by May of your second year, and a final defense in June of your second year. Right now, you don\u2019t need to worry about securing your research topic or anything like that. However, we know from experience that one of the keys to success in your MSc Thesis Project is selecting the right advisor. So, here are a few tips:\n\n- Take classes from different instructors and spend time getting to know them  \n- Gather feedback from older MSc and PhD students about their experience  \n- Try to participate in the lab work of several different labs  \n- Keep an open mind, even if you\u2019ve already decided who who want to work with  \n- Pay attention to how you work together, not just chat after class.

Skoltech provides academic mobility opportunities for its best performing students. Academic mobility allows a student\u2019s immersion into a worldwide ecosystem of science, research and innovations and provides a unique opportunity: \n\n- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  \n- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   \n- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   \n- to open new career prospects. *Text Overlay:* \n\n- to share your ideas and research findings with international scientific audience,  \n- to gain invaluable field experience and a broader professional network,   \n- to develop soft and interpersonal skills in a new and culturally diverse environment,   \n- to open new career prospects. Now, you may ask: who can apply for academic mobility or an academic trip? It could be students who show outstanding academic performance, have a Skoltech research advisor and a preliminarily defined MS thesis project. There are two academic mobility options:   \nFirst \\- Short-term trips to conferences of workshops\n\n*Text Overlay: Short-term trips to conferences of workshops*\n\nThis opportunity usually becomes available when first results of research work emerge, i.e. Term 1 \u2013 3 are completed. An applying student should be active and contributing participant of the event, presenting a paper or a poster. If you learn about an event you want to participate in, discuss it with your advisor or reach out your program coordinator and contactEducation Department to get further instructions and support. Second option \\- Long-term academic mobility\n\n*Text Overlay: Long-term academic mobility*\n\nThese trips are aimed to allow thesis research at highly ranked institutions and recognized research labs around the world. Skoltech competitively selects students\u2019 proposals and provides supporting grants for the approved academic trips. The selection is primarily based on the students\u2019 motivation and justification provided, showing how a trip contributes to the students\u2019 overall educational experience and path. Skoltech also looks at how a proposed mobility opportunity enables students to complete their degree at Skoltech and achieve their post-graduation career goals. The competition process includes primary screening by Education Department and assessment by the Programs. The call for applications is usually announced after Term 3 and the winning applicants schedule their trips to Term 6 \u2013 7\\. Moving on to Funding. *Text Overlay: Funding*\n\nCan be provided from a research advisor\u2019s funds or a CREI budget. Long-Term trips are supported by Education Department. We have prepared information on how to apply for you, along with guidelines for reporting after the academic trip, which you can find in the description below.

This status is reflected in the type of documentation they need to provide, such as the enrollment confirmation.\n\n2. **Registration Timeframe**: Students are typically required to register within 7 working days of their arrival, whereas other visitors might have a longer or shorter period depending on their visa type and the specific regulations.\n\n3. **Additional Documentation**: Along with the Migration Card, students must present a document from their educational institution, which verifies their enrollment and the duration of their stay. This is not a standard requirement for most other visitors.\n\n4. **Registration Location**: Students often register at the address of their educational institution or a designated student dormitory, while other foreigners might register at their place of residence or accommodation.\n\n5. **Legal Obligation**: The MIA closely monitors student registrations to ensure compliance with visa and residency rules, as the educational institution is responsible for reporting on the students' presence and status.\n\nThese differences reflect the importance of tracking and supporting the educational activities of foreign students in Russia.<|eot_id|>://user<|eot_id|>\n\nHow does the Migration Card help in the registration"
